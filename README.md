## Manufacturing and Costs

[PCBWay 1-Click Fabrication Method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2bPPwHPoG7xXpS1NCYEe3w_jD_ts0yRCp-2aQ6QoKY/)

#### The Domesday Duplicator is 3 Boards

DdD ADC (RF Input, Amplification & Filtering) (Fabrication Required)

DE0-Nano FPGA (Data Buffer) (Avaliable Off-Shelf)

FX3 USB 3.0 (Computer Interface) (Avaliable Off-Shelf)

### Parts Avaliblity Status

FX3 SuperSpeed Explorer Kit Status - Avalible at orignal MSRP rates. (30-50GBP)

DE0-Nano FFPGA Status - Shortages 100-200% Inflation. (100-140GBP) (MSRP 70-80GBP)

Due to inflation and shortages (2022) prices vary too much to recommend any spesific vendors in the USA/UK/Europe or Asia currently.

There is normally a 1-4 week manufacturing time but due to shipping costs its cheaper on a single unit basis to use a frabrication service, due to having to use sevreal vendors to aquire parts the total shipping cost makes it impractical unless making 5-20+ units this cost is around 125-150USD per board depending on provider with the example company being PCBWay witch ship globally.

## Required Files for Fabraciation!

The Gerber files this .zip file containes the specifications of the bare board and ware its taces/pads go witch is 2 layers.

The BOM or Bill Of Materials is the parts to be aquired and soldered to the pads/holes on the board, this is in the Microsoft .XLSX spredsheet format.

The POS File or Centroid file is the position data for though hole parts i,e positions to drill holes in the baord.

All these files are clearly layed out in this repository allowing drag and drop fabricaiton.

# Windows Software Installation

Today there is a [Windows Build](https://github.com/TokugawaHeavyIndustries/DomesdayDuplicator-WinBuild/releases/tag/v2.3) self-contained, just install USB libusb driver via ZigZag and you are ready to use the DdD.

Enable Amaplitude messurement

# Linux Software Installation

To compile the software on Ubuntu/Debian based distros, you will need Qt5 installed as well as the necessary support packages

The DdD application and two tools are now switched over to Cmake for compiling, for older versions please refure to older doc revisions.

Note: For current Ubuntu/Mint versions such as 22.04 you may need libqt5-dev and libgl-dev.

Dependencys Install: (Ubuntu 22.04 - Current)

    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git cmake libgl-dev qt6-base-dev libqt6serialport6-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev qt6-multimedia-dev build-essential

Applicaton Install:

    mkdir ~/github
    cd ~/github
    git clone https://github.com/simoninns/DomesdayDuplicator

Once the software is downloaded, simply issue the following commands to compile the application and its two utility applications `dddconv` and `dddutil`:

    cd ~/github/DomesdayDuplicator/Linux-Application
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .
    make -j8
    sudo make install

This will allow you to run the application using the following command:

    ~/DomesdayDuplicator/Linux-Application/DomesdayDuplicator/DomesdayDuplicator &

And should be avalible for quick lanuch inside Linux Mint once pinned to pannel.

By default CMake will install into `/usr/local`. To install into `/some/dir` instead, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/dir` to the `cmake` command.


## USB Device Permissions

In order for the GUI application to connect to the Domesday Duplicator USB device it is necessary to provide permissions for user-level access. For this you need to create a file called 40-domesdayduplicator.rules in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory (requires root permissions). The contents of the file should be as follows:

    # 1d50:603b - Domesday Duplicator
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="603b", MODE="0666"
    Once the file has been created, issue the following command to reload the USB configuration rules:

    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

Serial port device permissions
If you wish to use the automatic capture feature a serial connection between the Ubuntu PC and the laser video disc player is required (you will need an appropriate cable and USB to RS232 adapter). In order to access a serial device the Ubuntu user account must given the 'dialout' group permissions. This can be added to the current user account using the following command:

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Note that this permission does not become active until the user account has logged out and logged back in again.

## Synopsis

The Domesday Duplicator is a USB3 based DAQ capable of 40 million samples per second (20mhz of bandwith) aquisition of analogue RF data.

The hardware is a USB3 based 10-bit analogue to digital converter designed to allow the backup of Domesday AIV LaserDiscs (as well as generic laserdiscs and now Tape/CD media) through the direct sampling of the RF data from the optical head (laser) of a LaserDisc player.

The hardware/software solution is designed to act as a sampling front-end to the ld-decode (software decode of laserdiscs) project https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode and replaces the generic TV capture card to provide high-frequency sampling with 4 times the sample resolution.

There are 3 main components that make up the Domesday Duplicator:

A custom ADC board based around the Texas Instruments ADS825 10-Bit, 40MSPS analogue to digital converter.  This board contains an RF amplifier and conditioner (to amplify the output from the laserdisc player RF tap and condition it for the single-ended ADC chip) as well as headers for both the DE0-Nano FPGA development board and Cypress FX3 SuperSpeed Explorer board.  RF input is physically provided by a BNC connector.

Terasic DE0-Nano FPGA development board - The DE0-Nano is a low-cost FPGA development board containing an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA.  The DE0-Nano is used to process the raw 10-bit ADC data stream and provides FIFO buffering (towards the FX3) and sample conversion from unsigned 10-bit to scaled 16-bit signed data.  The FPGA provides a dual-clock FIFO; receiving ADC data at a maximum of 40 MSPS (million samples per second) and transmitting the data to the FX3 at a maximum of 60 MSPS.  This is to ensure that no data is lost during sustained transfers (as RF sampling of a disc can take more than 40 minutes).

Cypress FX3 SuperSpeed Explorer board - The FX3 is a low-cost USB3 development board from Cypress.  The FX3 is used to buffer data from the FPGA and provide it to a host computer using USB3.  USB3 is required for this application due to the high-data bandwidth necessary for high-speed/high-resolution sampling.

## Motivation

The Domesday86 project is involved in the documentation and preservation of the BBC Domesday Project from 1986.  The Domesday project provided a set of analogue laserdiscs in a proprietary format (like standard laserdiscs but with some specific extensions only supported by the Philips VP415 laserdisc player).

The Domesday Duplicator is intended to allow high-quality back-ups of the analogue information contained on the laserdiscs by bypassing most of the 30-year-old electronics in the VP415 player.  Direct RF sampling also allows all information on the laserdiscs to be stored (unlike conventional RGB sampling of the video output). 

Since AIV laserdiscs are a combination of video, pictures, sound and data (as well as numerous VBI streams), direct RF sampling is the preferred method of preservation, witch also applys to colour under analouge video tape formats such as (S)VHS, Umatic, BetaMax, Video 8, High8, BetaCam and so on.
